# Simple evolution simulator

A simple simulation of evolution. Created for Java and Objective Programming course at AGH UST.

Run using:
`./gradlew run`


The project was supposed to meet various criteria regarding code readability, objective programming principles and proper usage of Java. 
Because of that, some parts of the application may seem to be overcomplicated in their design. Obviously it was a test whether I can handle it
and stil implement all things properly. On the other hand the evolutionary portion of the project is not very clever - it could use some work 
to make things more interesting.

Task criteria described [here](https://github.com/apohllo/obiektowe-lab/tree/master/proj1)
