# Simple evolution simulator

A simple simulation of evolution. Created for Java and Objective Programming course at AGH UST.

Run using:
`./gradlew run`

#### About the project:
The project was supposed to meet various criteria regarding code readability, objective programming principles and proper usage of Java. 
Because of that, some parts of the application may seem to be overcomplicated in their design. Obviously it was a test whether I can handle it
and stil implement all things properly. On the other hand the evolutionary portion of the project is not very clever - it could use some work 
to make things more interesting.

#### Short description of what's going on:
There are animals on the map - they can rotate and move forward/backwards. An animal needs to eat plats to survive and reproduce.
Genes define animal's pattern of movement and as you would expect, they are passed from parents down onto their children.

Task criteria described [here](https://github.com/apohllo/obiektowe-lab/tree/master/proj1)
